# Project Name:
Jumper

# Description: 
A guessing game where the player atempts to guess letters in a mystery word with limited attempts. Every mistake damages their paratroopers parachute. If the word is succesfully guessed without making too many mistakes the paratrooper lands safely, if too many mistakes are made, the trooper falls and dies.

# Project Structure:
The project has 5 classes including the Director class. The User interface displays the mystery word and then accepts an input from the player. Words selects a random word from an array for the mysterty word. The Paratrooper class keeps track of the image of the paratrooper and has the ability to display him. Gamestate checks for gameover conditions as well as checks the guess from the user against the mystery word and stores the found words. The director contains the gameloop and runs all other classes to run the game.
